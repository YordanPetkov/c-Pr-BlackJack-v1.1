 rules :
 Blackjack is pretty simple.
The basic premise of the game is that
you want to have a hand value that is closer to 21
than that of the dealer, without going over 21.
Other players at the table are of no concern.
Your hand competes only against the hand of the dealer.
The rules of play for the dealer are strictly dictated,
leaving no decisions up to the dealer.
Therefore, there is no problem  with the dealer or any of the other players
at the table seeing the cards in your hand.
In fact, if you are playing at a shoe game,
the player cards are all dealt face up.
